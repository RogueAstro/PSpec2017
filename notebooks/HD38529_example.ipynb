    "The idea in this notebook is to fit exoplanet signals to the radial velocities of the star HD 38529. This system was observed several times and in various different instruments, which means we have plenty of data to work with. There are two confirmed exoplanets orbiting HD 38529.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code `radvel` is somewhat non-Pythonic in the fact that you run it from the command line instead of using scripts -- which means that, in practice, you don't need this Jupyter notebook to run it; so you could simply run these commands in the terminal if you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following line, we use the cell magic command `%%bash` to run `radvel` as if we were on the terminal. The syntax of running `radvel` is quite simple: we use the subcommand `fit` to perform the RV fitting and the option `-s` to use a setup file, which is included in the `codes` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will compute the **maximum likelihood** of the orbital parameters and instrumental parameters, and then produce some outputs in this \"terminal\" session, as well as a subfolder of our star in the `notebooks` folder."
