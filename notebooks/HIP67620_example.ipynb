    "`radial` is a simple program designed to do a not very trivial task: simulate radial velocities of a star orbited by a massive object or \"reverse engineer\" radial velocity measurements to estimate the orbital parameters of the system being studied. The formalism behind it is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1738.\n",

We start by importing the necessary packages. Notice that we will specifically import the modules `orbit`, `estimate`, and `dataset` from the `radial` package."
